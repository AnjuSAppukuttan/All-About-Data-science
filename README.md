The remarkable advancements in biotechnology and public healthcare infrastructures have led to a momentous production of critical and sensitive healthcare data. By applying intelligent data analysis techniques, many interesting patterns are identified for the early and onset detection and prevention of several fatal diseases like Diabetes.
This study compares multiple machine learning models and deep neural networks on the task of predicting diabetes risk from medical patient data. Different classes of machine learning algorithms, including but not limited to regression models, probabilistic models, linear models, ensemble methods, distance-based techniques and tree-based techniques can be leveraged. Here we use SVM, RF, LR,KNN and NB from ML approaches. Additionally, various deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and Multilayer Perceptrons are evaluated. Each unique approach processes features like lifestyle trends, personal history, and physical factors to output a probability estimate of diabetes onset. By benchmarking both traditional machine learning and modern deep learning philosophies on identical inputs, the comparative analysis illuminates relative real-world effectiveness beyond theoretical promises alone. Rather than assumptions about specific numbers of models and modalities, it is ultimately the empirical head-to-head evaluation between prevailing and emerging techniques that informs optimal selection based on predictive accuracy over promising but unproven alternatives.
